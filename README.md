One-hot encoding is a technique used in machine learning to convert categorical variables (like "Color: Red, Blue, Green") into a format that can be provided to algorithms that only understand numerical input. Each category is represented by a binary vector, where each unique category is turned into a column and assigned a 1 or 0 based on whether the observation belongs to that category.

Key Points:
One-Hot Encoding is essential when working with algorithms like linear regression or neural networks that can't interpret categorical data directly.
This method increases the dimensionality of the dataset but ensures that no unintended order or hierarchy is imposed on the categories (like with label encoding).
Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the transformation process:

Initial Categorical Data:

Color

Red

Blue

Green

Red

Blue

After One-Hot Encoding:

Color_Red	Color_Blue	Color_Green
1	         0	           0

0	         1	           0

0	         0	           1

1	         0	           0

0	         1	           0
In this way, one-hot encoding provides a method for converting categorical data into a format that can be fed into machine learning models.
